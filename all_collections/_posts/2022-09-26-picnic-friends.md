Picnic friends is a short cooking 2d point-and-click style game about a small community gathering meals for a big party.

The game was made in a team of 6, where everyone had their responsibilities. I was responsible for main gameplay and minigames: everythings that goes on in recipe scenes is coded by me.

While the game does not have a lot of mechanics by design, those that are present need to be as polished as possible, since players may not remember how complex or simple the game was, but will remember how the game made them feel. The game felt bland and at the end of development, so we added mechanics that help with discoverability and response:
- all the interactable stuff pops on hover, so the player would know what is pressable and what is not.
- almost every action on the recipe has some visual effect.
- added sound effect with increasing pitch to let the player know that he is making progress on recipe. 

The GIF below demonstrates the intractability of ingredients on the recipe scene.
