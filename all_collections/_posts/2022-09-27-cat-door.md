Cat Door is a prototype of a 3d puzzle platformer that focuses on non-euclidean geometry. This vision includes an unorthodox player controller, which allows for a player to walk on walls and ceiling. 

This mechanic has a lot of constraints, which includes:

- Ability to follow groundâ€™s curvature.
- Inability to follow ground on the right angles.
- Ability to jump.
- Ability to fall from cliffs.
