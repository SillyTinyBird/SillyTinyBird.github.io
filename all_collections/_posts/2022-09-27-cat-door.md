Cat Door is a prototype of a 3d puzzle platformer that focuses on non-euclidean geometry. This vision includes an unorthodox player controller, which allows for a player to walk on walls and ceiling. 

This mechanic has a lot of constraints, which includes:

- Ability to follow ground’s curvature.
- Inability to follow ground on the right angles.
- Ability to jump.
- Ability to fall from cliffs.

The gifs below show implemented in unity behavior.

_Demonstration of wall/cliff interaction._

I manage this by using the State pattern. Movement algorithm has following steps:

- On Ground. Initial state.
- On Edge. For when the player approached a cliff.
- In Air. For when the player is falling.
- Bumped. For when the player approached a wall.

UML diagrams are shown below.

Each state is represented by a class that derives from base class, which consists of a virtual function “Update” that dictates logic for players movement for each frame with the help of polymorphism.

This approach allows for simpler player transform manipulation, for example, gravitation-altering platform: when a player goes into trigger, their up direction changes onto the opposite and state changes to “In Air”.

```csharp
private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if(other.name == "Player")
        {
            player.SwitchState(player.stateAir);
            player.PreviousUpDirection *= -1;
        }
    }
```

Unfortunately, the prototype is still in the making and can not be played.
